<h3>Kinder Story Makers (<a href="http://storymakers.com" target="_blank">storymakers.com</a>)</h3>
<p>
   Story Makers  is a  site where kids and parents can create personalised childrens books.  The site has a highley interactive step by step process to generate stylised characters, stories and pages for the book.  Once created online, the book is then sent to publishers to be printed and delivered.
   <br>
   This  has proven to be a highly successful campaign  for Kinder, as nearly 50,000 books have been created within the first 6 months of the site launch. Far exceeding expected KPIs.  
   <br>
   I worked on both the front and back end of this site.
