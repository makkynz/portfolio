<h3>Ebay - Play Global (2015)</h3>
<p>
   This is an Ebay intranet accessed website used by Ebay staff as a training tool to learn and test their knowledge about Ebay's history and presence throughout the world. 
<br>
I worked on the backend of this site while working at Suburb. <br> Ebay approached us to build this tool to solve a problem where their staff in the US often knew little about what Ebay do in other countries.
