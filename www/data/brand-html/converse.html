<h3>Converse - Made by you Campaign  (2015)</h3>
<p>
  This is a portable digital kiosk built for Converse's pop-up studios around thr world.  This kiosk consisted of a large wooden box that contained  a high end camera, studio-like lighting and photo printer.  Customers would put their Converse shoes in the box and have them photographed.  The resulting printed photo of their shoes would look as if they were professionally shot.  
  <br><br>
  The kiosk also consisted of a Surface pro tablet with a custom  WPF application installed that the customers would interact with.  The WPF app collected the customer details and control with the camera via a Canon SDK

<h3>Converse - Sneaker Snap (2014)</h3>
<p>
    This is another portal digital kiosk built for Converse to be installed in 'Office' shoes stores in the UK. The kiosk consisted of a LCD TV, Surface Pro with custom WPF application,  photo printer,  and specially modified  Chuck Taylor shoes that have cameras and accelerometer sensors embedded in the toe. <br>
    The Chuck taylor shoe would sense when it was picked up by a customer and automatically take of photo from the emmbedded camera.  The photo would then be transmitted to the WPF application on the tablet, which then would display and the print the photo.
    <br>
    The customer would also interact with the WPF application to enter in Converse competitions with the photo.
