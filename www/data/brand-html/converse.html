<h3>Converse - Made by You Campaign</h3>
<p>
  This is a portable digital kiosk built for Converse's pop-up studios around that opened around Europe and the US.  This kiosk consisted of a large wooden box that contained a high end SLR camera, studio-like lighting and photo printer.  Customers would put their Converse shoes in the box and have them photographed.  The resulting printed photo of their shoes would look as if they were professionally shot.  
  <br><br>
  The kiosk also consisted of a Surface Pro tablet with a custom  WPF application installed that the customers would interact with.  The WPF app controlled the camera via a Canon SDK

<h3>Converse - Sneaker Snap</h3>
<p>
    This is another portal digital kiosk built for Converse to be installed in Office's flagship store on Oxford St in London. The kiosk consisted of a LCD TV, Surface Pro with custom WPF application,  photo printer,  and specially modified  Chuck Taylor shoes that have camera components and accelerometer sensors embedded in the toe. <br>
    The Chuck Taylor shoes would sense when they were picked up off the shelf by a customer, which would then trigger the embedded camera to take at photo.  The photo would then be transmitted to the WPF application on the tablet, to be displayed and printed.
    <br>
    The customer would also interact with the WPF application to enter into various Converse competitions with the photo.
