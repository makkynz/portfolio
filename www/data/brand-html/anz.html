    I've been involved in a number of projects for ANZ while working as a Senior Analyst Programmer for Aimia NZ.
    Two such projects were the ANZ World Visa website and ANZ Air New Zealand Airpoints integration system.
<p>
<h3>ANZ World Visa </h3>
<p>
   This was an custom e-commerce site for ANZ's World Visa credit card loyalty programme.  
   Customers would use this site to redeem their loyalty points for merchandise and vouchers.
   The backend system  processes and calculates loyalty points from raw  
   customer credit card transactions.

<h3>ANZ Airpoints </h3>
<p>
   This is a purely backend system that integrate ANZ's credit card loyalty programme with Air New Zealand's Airpoints programme. 
   On a daily schedule the system was responsible for receiving and processing ANZ credit card transactions, calculating Airpoints earned 
   (and expired), and then transmit Airpoints to Air New Zealand via their APIs.  
   <br>This system utilised Sql Server CLR integration with C# and SSIS.
