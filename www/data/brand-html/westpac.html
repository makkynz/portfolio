<p>
  Hotpoints is Westpac's credit card loyalty programme.  I worked on the front and back end developments of the loyalty points redemption website (hotpoints.co.nz).
  The backend system consisted of a complex points calculation engine that would process hundreds of thousands of credit transactions daily.  The backend also required to support the e-commerce functions of the points redemption site (e.g catalogue and order managment,  payment gateways).

  I worked on hotpoints whilst in my role as senior analyst programmer at Aimia Ltd.
