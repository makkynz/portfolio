<h3>Adidas MiCoach </h3>
<p>
   MiCoach is the physical activity tracking tool that is placed in Adidas running shoes.  
   I built a microsite for Adidas that enabled their customers to pull in their tracking data and graphically compare their states (e.g fastest sprint, longest distance ran) with that of a famous professional football players.

   I worked on both the front and back end of this site.
