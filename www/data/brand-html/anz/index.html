    I worked on a number of projects for ANZ while working as a Senior Analyst Programmer for Aimia NZ.
    Two such projects were the ANZ World Visa website and ANZ Air New Zealand Airpoints integration system.
<p>
<h3>ANZ World Visa (circa 2010)</h3>
<p>
   This was an custom e-commerce site for the ANZ's World Visa credit card loyalty programme.  
   Customers would use this site to redeem their loyalty points for merchandise and vouchers.
   The backend system  processes and calculates loyalty points from raw  
   customer credit card transactions.
   <br>
   This site is no longer live as it was intended to only exists for the lifetime of the loyalty programme campaign.
</p>

<h3>ANZ Airpoint (2011)</h3>
<p>
   This is a purely backend system that integrate ANZ's credit card loyalty programme with Air New Zealand's Airpoints programme. 
   On a daily schedule the system was responsible for receiving and processing ANZ credit card transactions, calculate Airpoints earned 
   (and expired), and then transmit Airpoints to Air New Zealand via their APIs.  
   <br>This system utilised Sql Server CLR integration with C# and SSIS.
