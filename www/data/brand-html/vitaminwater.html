<h3>Vitaminwater 2012 Olympics Campaign</h3>
<p>
   During the 2012 London Olympics, Vitaminwater ran a promotion  to give away Olympic event tickets, merchandise and exclusive downloadable Jessie J content.  Unique codes were printed on Vitaminwater bottles that the customer would then enter into the Facebook App microsite to check if they had won.

   I worked on developing both the front and backend areas of the Facebook App microsite.
