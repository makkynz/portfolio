<h3>JTI Pack Configurator</h3>
<p>
    Japanese Tobacco International (JTI) are a world leading Tobacco producer.  They own brands such as Camel, Benson &amp; Hedges, Silk Cut and American Spirit.

   I helped build a web based packaging pricing tool  for use within JTI's intranet.  Prior to this tool being available JTI sales team would need to use complex Excel spreadsheets (15 worksheets, 1000s of rows) to calculate packaging costs for the many variations that they come in.

   I worked on both the front and back end coding for this site.
